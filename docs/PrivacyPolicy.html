    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tzenter WhatsApp Bot</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> Feb 14, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Tzenter! This Privacy Policy explains how our WhatsApp bot operates and how we handle user data. Tzenter is designed to provide services via WhatsApp without storing, collecting, or sharing any personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Tzenter does not collect, store, or process any personal data from users. Our bot functions as a real-time communication tool without retaining any user messages, contacts, or other identifiable information.</p>
    
    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store any user data, there is no processing or sharing of information. Messages sent through the Tzenter WhatsApp bot are processed in real-time and not stored after they are delivered.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Tzenter operates solely within WhatsApp and does not integrate with third-party services that collect user data. However, WhatsApp itself may collect and process user data as per its own Privacy Policy. Please refer to WhatsApp’s official privacy policy for more details.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>As Tzenter does not store any user data unless a user chooses to register a Minyan, in which case their WhatsApp name and phone number are stored for coordination purposes only, there are no data security risks associated with data retention. All communications occur within WhatsApp’s encrypted environment.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services. Any changes will be posted here with the updated effective date.</p>
